# Grumboz_Dynamic_Capture_The_Flag
a simple version of my hyper dynamic capture the flag.

just add the world flag (Default id : 600000) at various locations and the system
will randomly select a flag to be searched for by the players.

just simply a flag will spawn and players must find it.

just use the `.ctf add` command to add a new flag to the world.
